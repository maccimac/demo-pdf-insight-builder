# How to run the project
Very straightforward. From root, 
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run start`
(Runs at localhost:3000)
3. For a more convenient buildingm use `npm run sass` run initialize sass compiling


#  UX + technical architecture choices
- Use of MU and Recharts
- This app is a one-page web application (`App.tsx` > `Home.tsx`). Routing is available but only used for Home.js.
- We use 2 main parent component `YourData.tsx` and `YourInsights.tsx`: 
   - `YourData.tsx ` (top section)  
        - `DatasetSelector.tsx`
        - `DatasetTableWrapper.tsx`
            - `DatasetFilters.tsx`
            - `DatasetTable.tsx`             
   - `YourInsight.tsx` (lower section)
        - `InsightView.tsx` (charts)
        - `InsightDesigner.tsx` (chart design form; saved views)
- Mock datas are stored in `/mock-data`
    - There are mocks for 50, 100, 200, and 500 rows which we can mix and match
    - Meta data of datasets are on `mock-data/datasets.ts`
- Component that cen be regularly reused are found in `/components` directory
    - ex: `PdfButton.tsx`, `PdfCustomTooltip.tsx` (tooltip for charting), `PdfSelector.tsx`
- Global data are store in `contexts/DataContext.tsx`
    - General use of `useContext`
    - Some data found here are: 
        - `datasetName` (name of currently selected dataset)
        - filter configs (types, range of date and numbers)
        - xAxis, yAxis, color, 
- `LocalStorage` is used to save views
    - localStorage key: `pdf_views_list` holds an array of insight views
- Types are stored in `types/index.ts`
- Utility files:
    - colors (from figma)
    - formatting date, sorting and filtering
    - `semiconductorProps.ts` - labelling for column keys
        ex: `life_span_years` = label: 'Lifespan', unit: 'year/s'
- Styles are also divided into
    - Modules: 1. `your-data.scss` ; 2. `your-insight.scss`
    - Utils - colors.scss, typography.scss, etc
- Additional packages: 
    - `react-color` for color picker
    - `@mui/x-date-pickers` for date picker
    - `react-app-rewired` for aliasing using @
        ex: import colors from `@utils/colors.js`


# What youâ€™d improve with more time 
- Add dark-mode
- Add ability to input additional lines for the chart
- Add options of more compatible colors
- Can upload dataset in csv or json for processing
- Smaller modularization of components
